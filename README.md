- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bgeierBK
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in getting started on a career in software engineering!
- ğŸŒ± I just finished an intensive 15-week bootcamp at FlatIron School where I learned Javascript, React, Python, Flask and more. I'm currently taking an online course to enhance my frontend knowledge, including Advanced React.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: I'm at geier.benjamin@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I worked as a journalist for almost 15 years before deciding to become a software engineer, and I'm excited to bring all of the creative skills I learned in that career to my new one.
